# 41. First Missing Positive

- For an array of length n, the first missing positive must be in [1, n+1], 这个是比较难想到的
    - There are only n valid positions for numbers 1..n
    - If all of them are filled correctly, the smallest missing must be n+1
    - Or the missing possitive should be x >= 1 && x < n+1
- So we try to put each number in its correct position
- Check for any number who's not in the correct position and the missing number is the answer
- time: O(n)
- space: O(1)
