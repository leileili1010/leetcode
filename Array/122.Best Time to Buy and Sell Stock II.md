# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

- The best strategy is to "take profit whenever you see it."
- Instead of trying to pick a perfect buy/sell pair, just accumulate all small profits.
- This mathematically equals the global optimum.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                res += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
