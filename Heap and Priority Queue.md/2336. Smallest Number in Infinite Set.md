# 2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set

![alt text](image-3.png)

- you have an infinite set, wanted to poll the smallest one from it, and also add back value only if the value is not in the infinite set.
- we dont need to put numbers in infinite set into another array or heap, we just use curr to track the smallest one that in the infinite set.
- any number we wanted to add has to be smaller than the curr (as everytime we polled smallest one, so all the number that could have been add back should be smaller than curr). 
- when we add back number, we dont add back to the infinite set, instead, we added it back to the minHeap. So minHeap has all the numbers(smaller than curr) that alreay added back to infinite set. 
- to save time, we use set to check if a number is in the minHeap. 

```java
class SmallestInfiniteSet {
    private int curr;
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;
    private Set<Integer> ifInMinHeap;

    public SmallestInfiniteSet() {
        curr = 1;
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        ifInMinHeap = new HashSet<>();
    }
    
    public int popSmallest() {
        if (minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            // no number has been added back yet
            return curr++;
        } 
        
        // already have some numbers added back and they are smaller than curr
        int smallest = minHeap.poll();
        ifInMinHeap.remove(smallest);
        return smallest;
    }
    
    public void addBack(int num) {
        if (num < curr && ifInMinHeap.add(num)) {
            minHeap.add(num);
        }
    }
}
