```java
// time: O(N^2)
// space: O(N)

class Solution {
    public int equalPairs(int[][] grid) {
        int count = 0;
        int[] ele = new int[grid.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid.length; j++) {
                ele[j] = grid[j][i];
            }
           
           for(int[] ints: grid) {
               if (Arrays.equals(ints, ele)) count++;
           }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

Time and space complexity analysis

- Time Complexity:
  - Nested Loops: The method uses two nested loops. The outer loop runs for grid.length times, and the inner loop also runs for grid.length times.
The time complexity of the nested loops is O(N^2), where N is the size of the grid.
Array Copying:

  - Inside the outer loop, there's an array copying operation (ele[j] = grid[j][i]) which runs in O(N) time.
Array Equality Check:

  - The array equality check (Arrays.equals(ints, ele)) is done inside the inner loop and runs in O(N) time since it needs to compare N elements.
The dominant factor is the nested loops, so the overall time complexity is O(N^2).

- Space Complexity:
  - Array: An array ele of length grid.length is used to store a column of elements from the grid.
The space complexity for this array is O(N).

  - Total Space Complexity: The total space complexity is O(N) due to the array ele.

- Conclusion: The time complexity is O(N^2), and the space complexity is O(N). The algorithm has a quadratic time complexity, which may not be efficient for large input sizes. Additionally, the use of the array ele could be avoided, which might lead to a more efficient solution.
