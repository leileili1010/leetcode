# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

## Approach 1 - Divide and Conquer

The string would be split only when we find an invalid character. An invalid character is the one with a frequency of less than k. As we know, the invalid character cannot be part of the result, we split the string at the index where we find the invalid character, recursively check for each split, and combine the result.
- Base case: If the length of the current substring (end - start) is less than k, the method returns 0, as it is impossible to have a substring with at least k repeating characters.
- Build the countMap with the frequency of each character in the string s.
- Find the position for mid index by iterating over the string. The mid index would be the first invalid character in the string.
- To make it more efficient, we ignore all the invalid characters after the mid index as well, thereby reducing the number of recursive calls.
    - aabcdxxx, mid = b, midnext = x, 中间cd被跳过更efficiet, 因为他们本身也不valid, 所以不用以它们为mid来分，直接跳过
- Split the string into 2 substrings at the mid index and recursively find the result.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubstring(String s, int k) {
        return longestSubstringUtil(s, 0, s.length(), k);
    }

    int longestSubstringUtil(String s, int start, int end, int k) {
        // 1. base case
        if (end < k) return 0;
        
        // 2. countMap track char freq
        int[] countMap = new int[26];
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++)
            countMap[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        
        // 3-1. find split index 
        for (int mid = start; mid < end; mid++) {
            if (countMap[s.charAt(mid) - 'a'] >= k) continue;
            int midNext = mid + 1;
            while (midNext < end && countMap[s.charAt(midNext) - 'a'] < k) midNext++;
            return Math.max(longestSubstringUtil(s, start, mid, k),
                    longestSubstringUtil(s, midNext, end, k));
        }
        // 3-2. if the whole string is valid, return it's length (end-start)
        return (end - start);
    }
}
```
- time: O(N^2)
    - Each level of recursion involves iterating over the substring once (O(N)).
    - In the worst case, the depth of recursion can be O(N) because in the worst case, the substring might be split into two parts recursively for each non-repeating character
    - Therefore, the total time complexity is O(N^2). This is because, in the worst case, for every level of recursion (which can be up to N), we perform a linear scan over the string, leading to a O(N) * O(N) = O(N^2) time complexity.
- Space: O(N), This is the space used to store the recursive call stack. The maximum depth of recursive call stack would be O(N)
