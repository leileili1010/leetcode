- using preorder DFS， 因为每一条路径都要经过各个根节点，我们需要比较根节点的值和max的值，这样才能和后面的节点进行比较

```java
class Solution {

    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    }

    // we need a helper function because we need to udpate maxVal;
    public int dfs(TreeNode root, int maxVal) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int res = 0;
        if (root.val >= maxVal) {
            res = 1;
            maxVal = root.val;
        } else {
            res = 0;
        }

        res += dfs(root.left, maxVal);
        res += dfs(root.right, maxVal);

        return res;
    }
}

- Time Complexity Analysis:
  - Traversal: The code traverses each node of the binary tree once. In the worst-case scenario, where the binary tree is completely unbalanced (essentially a linked list), the time complexity of traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Operations: At each node, the code performs a constant number of operations (comparison, assignment, and addition), which do not depend on the size of the input tree. Therefore, these operations do not contribute significantly to the overall time complexity.
  - Overall: The dominant factor is the traversal, so the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

- Space Complexity Analysis:
  - Recursion Stack: The space complexity of the recursion stack depends on the maximum depth of the recursion, which is the height of the tree. In the worst-case scenario, where the tree is completely unbalanced, the height of the tree is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Therefore, the space complexity due to recursion is O(n).
  - Other Variables: The code uses a constant amount of extra space for the res variable and the maxVal parameter in each recursive call. These variables do not depend on the size of the input tree and do not contribute significantly to the overall space complexity.
  - Overall: Combining the space complexity of the recursion stack and the other variables, the overall space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

- In summary, the time complexity of the given code is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
