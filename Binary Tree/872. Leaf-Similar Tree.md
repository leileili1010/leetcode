```java
class Solution {
    public boolean leafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        List<Integer> leaves1 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> leaves2 = new ArrayList<>();

        checkLeaves(root1, leaves1);
        checkLeaves(root2, leaves2);

        return leaves1.equals(leaves2);
    }

    public void checkLeaves(TreeNod root, List<Integer> leaves) {
        if (root == null) return;

        if (root.left == null & root.right == null) {
            leaves .add(root.val);
        }

        checkLeaves(root.left, leaves);
        checkLeaves(root.right, leaves);
    }
}

- Time Complexity Analysis:
  - Traversal: The code traverses each tree once to collect the leaf values. Since each node is visited exactly once, the time complexity for this traversal is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in both trees.
  - List Comparison: After collecting the leaf values, the code compares the two lists. List comparison takes O(n) time, where n is the size of the larger list between leaves1 and leaves2.
  - Overall, the dominant factor is the traversal of the trees, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in both trees.

- Space Complexity Analysis:
  - List Storage: The code uses two lists, leaves1 and leaves2, to store the leaf values. Each list can potentially store up to n/2 leaf values (in a completely unbalanced tree), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree.
  - Recursion: The space complexity of the recursion depends on the maximum depth of the recursion stack, which is the height of the tree. In the worst case (completely unbalanced tree), the height of the tree is n, where n is the total number of nodes.
  - Combining these, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree.

In summary, the time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in both trees.
