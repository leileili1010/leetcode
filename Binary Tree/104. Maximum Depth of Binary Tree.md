# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

![alt text](image.png)

```java
class Solution {
    private int height = 0;

    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        height = 0;
        helper(root, 1);
        return height;
    }

    public void helper (TreeNode root, int depth) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }

        height = Math.max(height, depth);
        helper(root.left, depth + 1);
        helper(root.right, depth + 1);
    }
}
```

- The time complexity of the given solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the helper function is called recursively on each node exactly once, and each node is visited only once.

- The space complexity of the given solution is between O(logN) and O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the recursion stack can have at most n frames, one for each node in the binary tree, in the worst case scenario (e.g., for a skewed binary tree). O(logN) if it is balanced binary tree or perfect binary tree.
