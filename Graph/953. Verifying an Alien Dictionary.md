# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

We can track net trust for each person.
    - When someone trusts another, they lose 1 point.
    - When someone is trusted, they gain 1 point.
    - At the end: The judge’s total score will be n − 1 (trusted by all others, trusts none).

```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        // edge case
        if (trust.length == 0 && n == 1) return 1;
        int[] count = new int[n+1]; 

        for (int[] pair: trust) {
            int a = pair[0];
            int b = pair[1];
            count[a]--;
            count[b]++;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (count[i] == n-1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
