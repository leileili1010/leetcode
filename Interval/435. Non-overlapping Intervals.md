# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

- 这道题要和56 merge interval 对比，不同之处在于 56 是sort by start time, 而这道题是sort by end time
- The goal in LeetCode 56 is to merge all overlapping intervals. To determine if intervals overlap, we need to compare the start of the current interval to the end of the previous one. So, it makes sense to sort by the start time, then iterate through the list and check if the current interval overlaps with the last one in the merged list.
- for 435, sorting by end time ensures that we always try to keep the interval that allows the maximum room for future non-overlapping intervals. The main idea should be: If an interval overlaps, we should remove the one that has the larger end time to minimize the overlap.
- Summary
    - If you’re merging intervals → check for overlap., sort by start time
    - If you’re filtering, counting, or avoiding overlap → check for no-overlap, sort by end time


```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a,b) -> (a[1]-b[1]));
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int iStart = intervals[i][0];
            int iEnd = intervals[i][1];

            if (iStart >= end) {
                end = iEnd;
            } else {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
